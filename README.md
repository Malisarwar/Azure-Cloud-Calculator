# Azure-Cloud-Calculator
#### In this project, we have developed an online web calculator application via using Platform as a Service (PaaS) model at developers end and for delivering our application as a service to each user Software as a Service (SaaS) model is used. Application is deployed on Microsoft’s publicly available cloud MS Azure. 

##Intoduction
#### The goal of the assignment is to deliver a software solution that does not run or install on the client machine but rather it is provided to the user over the cloud, so that there is no overhead in terms of installation or performance in terms of underling hardware on which it would have run on. The solution rather solves the performance issue by running the software on a virtual server that is provided within the cloud.Cloud computing involves the use of cloud services to deliver a wide range solutions. Top among them is Software as a Service (SaaS) to deliver a software solution to multiple users that will beneﬁt from that software service. The solution looks and feels like a stand alone solution for a single user to use as if it was installed on the users system and not used by any other user, but the beneﬁt of SaaS is that multiple users are provided the same software solution, without each one knowing of the others usage. The same solution is actually used by many users without any performance issues and with quick response from server side, so that any heavy computation that may have slowed down the client machine does not become a bottleneck in terms of performance.
