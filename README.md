# Azure-Cloud-Calculator
#### In this project, we have developed an online web calculator application via using Platform as a Service (PaaS) model at developers end and for delivering our application as a service to each user Software as a Service (SaaS) model is used. Application is deployed on Microsoft’s publicly available cloud MS Azure. 

## Intoduction
#### The goal of the assignment is to deliver a software solution that does not run or install on the client machine but rather it is provided to the user over the cloud, so that there is no overhead in terms of installation or performance in terms of underling hardware on which it would have run on. The solution rather solves the performance issue by running the software on a virtual server that is provided within the cloud.Cloud computing involves the use of cloud services to deliver a wide range solutions. Top among them is Software as a Service (SaaS) to deliver a software solution to multiple users that will beneﬁt from that software service. The solution looks and feels like a stand alone solution for a single user to use as if it was installed on the users system and not used by any other user, but the beneﬁt of SaaS is that multiple users are provided the same software solution, without each one knowing of the others usage. The same solution is actually used by many users without any performance issues and with quick response from server side, so that any heavy computation that may have slowed down the client machine does not become a bottleneck in terms of performance. 

## Model 
#### Cloud calculators are basically wont to aggregate data for the IT professional and with a concise set of calculators to assist size computing environments appropriately. The marketing world is an ever-changing, dynamic place. Its technology, trends, and tactics never stay stagnant for long. A calculator may be a simple and solid thanks to add value to your website. instead of browsing through reams of phone book or scrolling through blogs, the calculator mixes things up and makes your audience take more interest during a new page.Avoiding the issues caused by conventional calculators that’s more powerful and arguably much easier to use. the answer has been implemented. This shows an interactive system that’s declarative, with the beneﬁts of clarity and power that entails. It frees people from understanding how a calculation should be expressed to concentrating on what they need solved. a crucial contribution is to demonstrate the very serious problems users face when using conventional calculators, and hence what a freedom a declarative design brings, through cloud scale ability, cost efﬁciency, Availability and reliability might be tackled. The Flow of this entire work can be seen in below Fig.In this module, An Actor or user only see the GUI of the web app and according to provided services,User can generate a request whatever he/she want from that GUI. Then Operation Requests reached to Cloud via network connection and then cloud deals with that operation and give the result to the web app where user can see the results of operations which is performed by him or her. Then our system generate a log ﬁles where all user’s data can be saved for future reference.With this system also show the individual’s logs in show my log button as well as user also can download his logs or can clear the logs.
